# FH5-Launcher
A small script writen in python to start Forza Horizon 5 without internet to  circumvent the error 0x800701b1


The install.bat file installs both the newset version of python from the Microsoft Store and the required library, psutil. 
If you already have both of these or wish to install either of them manually you don't need to run the file.

Then you will also need to edit the launcher.py file with the correct path to your FH5 executable. (Right-klick launcher.py -> open with -> select any text editor)

Now just run the launcher.py as admin and you should be good to go!

I have not yet been able to test this on any other pc than mine, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.
